  abstract = {Longitudinal study designs are commonly applied in much scientific research, especially in the medical, social, and economic sciences. Longitudinal studies allow researchers to measure changes in each individual's responses over time and often have higher statistical power than cross-sectional studies. Choosing an appropriate sample size is a crucial step in a successful study. In longitudinal studies, because of the complexity of their design, including the selection of the number of individuals and the number of repeated measurements, sample size determination is less studied. This paper uses a simulation-based method to determine the sample size from a Bayesian perspective. For this purpose, several Bayesian criteria for sample size determination are used, of which the most important one is the Bayesian power criterion. We determine the sample size of a longitudinal study based on the scientific question of interest, by the choice of an appropriate model. Most of the methods of determining sample size are based on the definition of a single hypothesis. In this paper, in addition to using this method, we determine the sample size using multiple hypotheses. Using several examples, the proposed Bayesian methods are illustrated and discussed.},

  abstract = {Sample size calculations based on two-sample comparisons of slopes have been reported by many. This paper extends such discussions to include summary statistics other than slopes, such as post-baseline means, change scores, and final observations. Specifically, sample size formulas for analyses based on a broad class of summary statistics are presented, with modifications proposed to allow for missing data caused by staggered entry and random dropouts. The formulas developed are used to illustrate how required sample size is affected by summary statistic choice, variance parameters, the type of treatment difference of interest, and the manner in which incomplete observations are used in the analysis. An example based on longitudinal data from the Muscatine Study is presented.},

  abstract = {Summary statistics, such as slope or area under the time-response curve, reduce the dimensionality of repeated measures data and can thereby simplify the comparison of groups in longitudinal studies. Since summary statistic distributions vary according to the amount, timing, and type of any missingness that occurs, one must choose between analysing the data unconditionally or conditionally on the missingness patterns. This paper uses simulations to compare such unstratified and stratified summary statistic analyses with respect to their size and power under models that allow for both non-informative and informative missingness mechanisms. Of particular interest is the robustness of these methods to violations of the assumptions that one must make if they are to have proper test size. It is found that stratification of the analysis tends to result in an increase of power, and improves the robustness to violations of missing data assumptions.},

  abstract = {In many randomized clinical trials with repeated measures of a response variable one anticipates a linear divergence over time in the difference between treatments. This paper explores how to make an efficient choice of analysis based on individual patient summary statistics. With the objective of estimating the mean rate of treatment divergence the simplest choice of summary statistic is the regression coefficient of response on time for each subject (SLOPE). The gains in statistical efficiency imposed by adjusting for the observed pre-treatment levels, or even better the estimated intercepts, are clarified. In the process, we develop the optimal linear summary statistic for any repeated measures design with assumed known covariance structure and shape of true mean treatment difference over time. Statistical power considerations are explored and an example from an asthma trial is used to illustrate the main points. 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Factors that influence the required sample size, such as the number of repeated measurements, the structure of the within-subject correlation, and their interaction, were investigated in detail.},
